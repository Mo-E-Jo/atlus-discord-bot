# Atlus Games Discord bot Project

## A TypeScript-Powered Discord bot for discovering enemy weaknesses in Atlus Games

The Atlus Games Discord Bot is designed to help players quickly identify the weaknesses of enemies in popular Atlus RPGs, including Persona 3 Reload (including Episode Aigis), Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Royal, and Metaphor: ReFantazio. Instead of searching through multiple tabs or wikis to find enemy weaknesses, simply tell the bot the game and enemy you're facing, and it will provide a detailed weakness chart. Plan your strategy in advance or uncover unexpected vulnerabilities mid-battle, all without leaving Discord!

## Watch the video to get a feeling of how the Atlus Games Discord bot works!

Has this ever happened to you? -> (Last time before save: 2 hours maybe) Video will be a party from metaphor/persona walking up to an enemy they haven't seen before and completely getting deflected by a move killing the protag. 

NOW INTRODUCING The Atlus Games discord bot where you simply type in the name of the game and the enemy and you'll never run into a situation like that again. Show a seal of approval then the logo of the bot (link in description)
